## Salaam ðŸ‘‹

Project bilal is a couple of muslims putting together a dedicated rpi project to cast athans to local google devices.  

This project has taken lots of inspiration from home assistant, and wanted to simplify the onboarding process for users who are only looking for one functionality... 
calling the athan on their google speakers. 

ðŸš§ This project is currently under development ðŸš§
